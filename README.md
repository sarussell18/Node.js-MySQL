# Node.js-MySQL
I have created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The store will show products for sale, including title, category, price, and quantity. If the product is sold out it will then send you an alert. 
This example is available for people to use if your looking to create an amazon style store.
